In-progress hobby OS. Currently doesn't do much, just boots properly, starts some paging memory management, initializes some devices like APICs and timers. Various scaffholding in progress towards supporting the first user-space process.

The OS isn't made in JavaScript, it's just a (stretch) goal for the user and application interface to be JavaScript-themed.
